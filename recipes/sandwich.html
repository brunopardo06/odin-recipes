            <h2>Chicago-Inspired Italian Beef Sandwich</h2>
            <p>
                I tried to combine the traditional Italian beef sandwich with the French dip sandwich with a little nod to the pulled pork sandwich. 
                Instead of using thinly sliced roast beef, I used stew beef, with apologies to my friends from Chicago.

            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Season beef with a pinch of salt and black pepper. Heat vegetable oil in a heavy pot over high heat. 
                    Cook and stir beef in hot oil until browned, 5 to 8 minutes.</li>
                <li>Stir garlic, vinegar, oregano, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt, thyme, rosemary, 1 teaspoon black pepper, bay leaf, and red pepper flakes into beef. 
                    Pour enough chicken broth into beef mixture to cover the meat by 1 inch and bring to a simmer.</li>
                <li>Cover pot with a lid, reduce heat to low, and simmer until meat is fork-tender, 1 to 1 1/2 hours.</li>
                <li>Transfer meat with a strainer or slotted spoon to a separate pot; pour about 1/4 cup of meat broth into pot. 
                    Use a wooden spoon to gently break meat into smaller chunks. 
                    Cover pot with a lid or aluminum foil and keep warm.</li>
                <li>Skim excess grease from top of broth remaining in the first pot; season with salt and pepper to taste. 
                    Cover pot with a lid or aluminum foil and keep broth warm.</li>
                    <li>Lay halves of a roll out on a work surface and spoon 2 to 3 tablespoons meat broth over each half. 
                        Top bottom half of roll with a generous portion of meat and a spoonful of pickled vegetables. 
                        Place tops on sandwich. Repeat with remaining buns, broth, meat, and pickled vegetables to make 3 more sandwiches.</li>
                        <li>Spoon hot meat broth into ramekins and top each ramekin with 1/2 teaspoon parsley. 
                            Serve sandwiches with hot broth for dipping.</li>
            </ol>
